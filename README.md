# Advent Of Code

[Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) is an event of programming puzzles,
more info can be found in the about section of the site!

I am participating in the 2024 event casually, using Go since I want to get
better at it! I created this repo to store my solutions.

Let me know if I did something inefficient, or I could've done something
better, I want to learn!

# How to run

This year, I created a project using [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)
so that it's easy to create new days without having to work hard to prepare it
all in advance (lesson from last year) and also easy to run, e.g.:

Run the test:
```sh
go test ./cmd/year2024/day1/...
```

Run the actual file:
```sh
go run main.go 2024 day1
```

# My Scores

These are times and ranks for the days I've completed:

The times are time since the puzzle was posted, not since I started solving.

| Day | Part 1 Time | Part 1 Rank | Part 2 Time | Part 2 Rank |
|-----|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
